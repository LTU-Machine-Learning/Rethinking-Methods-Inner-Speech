This repository contains codes for paper titled as 'Rethinking the Methods and Algorithms for Inner Speech
Decoding - and Making them Reproducible'. 

The code is divided into following chunks: Preprocessing, training, and testing. The folder details are as follows

1. Preprocessing:

This folder contains, files and functions which were used during the preprocessing of both vowel and words. Here, folders
